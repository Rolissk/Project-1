# Setup
1. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Rolissk/rolis-casino
```
2. Check your folder path using pwd and paste that in config.json
3. Run the app using python3 main.py

This is my first project after like 2 months of learning, so dont expect epic MLG gaming.

Before launching main.py, you MUST replace path to Project1 in the config.json which is stored in main folder.

You can use the log in (name: q, pass: qq) or register and make your own account, it wont have unlimited money tho,
new users get 100 money.

Project1 includes a functioning register and log in function, multiple simple games which all cost 5 money to play once
and if you win, you obviously get money. With the money you earn you can purchase items in shop which will appear in your inventory 
or use the cash out function and imagine that you get the money.

All your data gets stored locally on your computer after you quit the game, once you reopen it, just log in and continue gabling!
